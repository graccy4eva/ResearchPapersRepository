But precise operational definition depends on context. Some other researchers argue that as long as people are using ICT, what the do with ICT is not our concerns.

The paper emphasize on categorizing different digital resources and digital exclusion. Online and offline exclusin mediates (instead of indicators) each other and correspond to resources. and resources in offline will most likely influence the corresponding resources online. ""A consequence of the corresponding fields model is that, even if an individual
engages with a certain digital field and thus benefits from this, those with more resources still take more advantage of the same type of uses."" Social exclusion also include personal motivation and agency

Access: Any operationalization of access to ICTs should go beyond having some kind of access somewhere incorporating aspects like quality, mobility, and ubiquity.
Skills: Any operationalization of access to ICTs should go beyond having some kind of access somewhere incorporating aspects like quality, mobility, and ubiquity. Basic access to and use of ICTs might be more strongly associated with general self-efficacy
Attitude: should probably include opinions about the availability, appropriateness, and regulation of content, as well as attitudes about effects of problematic content such asviolence, sexual, political, and commercial content on vulnerable groups or society
in general

Some researchers argue that we should incorporate people's own understanidng of what it means by ""inclusion"" but this paper examines objectively what they actually do in the four fields of digital inclusion once access, skills and attitudes have been accounted for.

the authors gave some examples: the impact of broadband may not be on performance (economic field) but on self-esteem (personal field). those who use social networking apps are the ones most likely to increase offline social resources.

Is there a correlation between parent participation (in school management) and student success?

The author found no evidence that parent participation in school management contributed to improving student achievement.

""Parent participation in school management has been promoted as a strategy for holding schools accountable for education quality and outcomes. However, the evidence has proven inconclusive and limited in explaining mechanisms to affect student achievement. By using public school student data derived from the Programme for International Student Assessment 2015, this study examines how 1) participation of a student’s own parents in school management, which would affect their learning support at home and 2) participation of a group of parents, which would influence school decisions and thus affect the learning environment at school, are associated with student achievement in Croatia, Georgia, Portugal, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, Korea, Hong Kong, and Macao. I found no evidence that parent participation in school management contributed to improving student achievement. Instead, depending on the country, a negative association is derived from either individual-level or school-level parent participation. The associations are not moderated by parents’ socioeconomic status but by school’s openness to parental engagement in some of the countries, indicating that what matters might not be participation per se but the degree of engagement. The findings underscore the importance of understanding mechanisms and conditions in which parent participation affects student learning in context to design effective participatory school governance.From 1998 to 2006, parents become less concerned about children exposed to sex, violence, adult language content on internet. African American parents are more conerned in this area than Hispanic parents, than White parents. But most parents think today's media is more harmful than in the past.

This study utilized data from the TIMSS 2007. To compare the effect size of technology use, multi-group analyses of the path model were performed with Analysis of Moment Structures. The result shows that later immigrated students’ technology use is positively related to their mathematics performance. They may gain more benefits from technology use than moderately or early immigrated student groups. It is reasoned that later immigrated Hispanic students may reduce their learning hindrance associated with cultural barriers or limited English proficiency by using educational technology. Enhancement in the investment of educational technology into this subgroup may narrow the achievement gap between later immigrated, moderately immigrated, and early immigrated students.""","Access to technology is important to Hispanic students, and especially to who are later immigrants who may face greater language barriers.

Results revealed that parents' perceived usefulness and parental support can effectively foster students' learning motivation, which leads to students' flow experience in visual programming learning. The impact of parents' perceived usefulness on students' learning motivation was particularly more salient in the low creative student group (vs. high creative student group).

We examine the internet connection type used by families, the technology experiences of lower-income parents, and their perceptions of opportunities that technology use offers their children. We then determine how these factors influence the frequency and scope of their school-age children's technology use. Findings show that contextualizing children's connectivity to account for infrastructural, socio-demographic, and relational influences provides new insights into the technology experiences of lower-income children. One set of findings suggests that direct benefit from increased connectivity is most evident for lower-income parents - those with the lowest household incomes, lowest levels of education, and whose dominant language is not English. These effects remain after controlling for other socio-demographic factors. The second set of results shows that greater connectivity increases how frequently both children and parents use the internet, but is associated only with a greater scope of internet activities for parents. Parents' online activity scope is important for their children's online experiences, directly predicting the scope of their online activities. High-scope parents were also significantly more likely to see digital opportunities in their children's internet use, which in turn also predicted more frequent and broader internet use by their children.

Although this shift has been incorporated into the more broad social inclusion agenda, the social consequences of the digital divide have not yet received adequate attention. Recognizing that political knowledge is a critical social resource associated with power and inclusion, this study empirically examines the relationship between the digital divide and the knowledge gap. Based on the 2008-2009 American National Election Studies panel data, this research found that, supporting the shift of the academic agenda, socioeconomic status is more closely associated with the informational use of the Internet than with access to the Internet. In addition, socioeconomic status is more strongly related to the informational use of the Internet than with that of the traditional media, particularly newspapers and television. More importantly, the differential use of the Internet is associated with a greater knowledge gap than that of the traditional media.

We found that a) many teachers had the digital competency for classroom instruction, they could not engage effectively with their students due to inadequate training for online instruction and limited digital tools and resources, b) teachers' level of digital competency corresponded with their self-efficacy, and c) the COVID-19 Pandemic further exposed the existing digital divide and inequitable distribution of resources.”",N/A,N/A,"Learning, Teacher, Digital, Online, Technology, Self-efficacy","Remote teaching and remote learning, Access to digital device",US,,,Check,Teachers

""

-""These experiences vary somewhat by income level. About half of upper-income parents (51%) say their elementary, middle or high school children have received a lot of online instruction since their school closed; a smaller share of those in the lower income tier (38%) say the same. Conversely, about three-in-ten lower-income parents (29%) say their children’s school has provided not much or no instruction, versus 13% of those in the upper income group who say this. Among middle-income parents, 44% say their children have received a lot of online instruction from their school.""",N/A,N/A,"Parents, Children, Schools, Income, Instruction, Worry, Concern","Digital learnig, Digital resources",US,Check,,,Parents
