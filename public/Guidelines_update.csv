This guideline suggests that dotted, dashed or incised grid style be adopted to make it easier for tactile users to understand","Grid lines are often used in tactile chart design which indicates their importance.

elements, for example in the case of scatter plots. Grid lines are frequently used orthogonal to a metric scale. Beyond that, over the half of bar charts contain horizontal grid lines to clarify specific values. In bar charts they do not cause
much cluttering. It might be a relation between the size of chart elements and usefulness of grid lines. On average, there are 7.8 horizontal grid lines in one chart which is very similar to the number of tick marks on the y axis. That is, in most of the analyzed charts one grid line per major unit of orthogonal axis with a starting point on a tick mark was used. Minor units are rarely used. One example with vertical bars displays the grid lines only within the bars itself [9]. This shows the tradeo between the use of grid lines for reading values and avoiding cluttering by combining grid lines and the texture of bars. The reader can count the linesdirectly on the object of interest - without the need of switching focus to the corresponding axis. A disadvantage of this approach is that the user cannot trace a specific grid line for finding all elements with the target value. Most grid lines are designed with solid line style.

tactile feedback was too limited in size and resolution to provide sufficient contextual information to allow the user to explore the graph. An alternative means of input therefore had to be used. A common strategy with other accessibility aids was to use one hand to interpret the information, while the other hand guided or controlled exploration. This could be observed with non-technical aids such as Braille or raised paper diagrams, or with dynamic displays such as the use of 
cursor keys for controlling a refreshable Braille display",,None,None,None,,,,

This guideline recommends that tactile users are provided with grooves rather than reliefs to consistently navigate through data and get an accurate interpretation of them. Because reliefs will require the use of pen which users are required to hold firm everytime they interact with data,"Use grooves rather than a relief to constrain exploration: While the tangible relief was useful, the users had problems holding the pen steady, especially when clicking the button to access speech. A groove that the tip of the pen slipped into would constrain the user to a circular track, affording them quicker and more stable exploration",,None,None,None,,,,

This guideline recommends that tactile users should be given proportion based information with an option to explore details about this proportion.,"Use clear and concise speech to deliver detailed information on demand: The speech information is so fundamental to blind users that they will rapidly identify any short-comings. Problems with speech clarity can undermine the performance of a system as a whole. Clarity of speech was responsible for at least 44% of the erroneous responses given to questions. The speech should not deliver too much
information, as this could distract the user and overload working memory. As such, the user should be able to cancel the speech on demand. In the case of pie charts, listening to the value and the proportion was quite demanding for the users. Future versions of the system will give proportion information only, as this is the essence of the pie chart representation. The user could request the additional information on exact value, or instead switch to a bar chart representation.",,None,None,None,,,,

This guideline recommends the following order for narratives to be easily interpreted: type of graph; describe the horizontal axis; describe the vertical axis; describe labels; describe units; describe range of data: minimum to maximum; describe line; describe coordinates; state how the line is curved (Describe for each line in multi-line charts). For example, The line graph shows the number of hours of daylight in Seattle, WA, USA, from January to December. The x-axis is labeled ""Month"" and the y-axis is labeled ""Hours of Daylight."" The range of numbers on the x-axis is 1-12, and the range of numbers on the y-axis is 0-16. The line starts at (1,0) in the bottom left corner and rises slightly to (2,2). It then declines moderately to (3,4) and rises slightly to (4,6). The line then curves slightly upward to (5,8) and (6,10). It then declines moderately to (7,12) and rises slightly to (8,14). The line then curves moderately upward to (9,16) and (10,14). It then declines moderately to (11,12) and (12,10), reaching the end of the line at (12,10) in the top right corner.","State that it is a line graph. Describe axes, horizontal then vertical, with labels and units. Include the range of numbers for each axis. To describe the line, state the starting point, then direction and pitch to next point (e.g.rises slightly, declines moderately), then state the coordinates and repeat until the end of the line is reached. If the line is curved, state so in the description. For example, “curves slightly upward” or “curves moderately downward”. If there are no points on the line, estimate points that are near major tick-marks, and describe trends in between. For multiple lines on one set of axes, describe each line individually, but if the lines cross at any points, state so in the description.

This guideline recommends providing users with multimodal systems (haptic and speech). The haptic-based system will support them to quickly navigate through data while the speech feedback will give them details about the data.,"A well-designed system will make full use of the complementary effect of the multimodality so that strengths of each modality will be amplified and limitations will be alleviated. Based on the experimental findings, haptics is suitable for navigation and guidance type of tasks, whereas speech and non-speech audio can be used to present detailed and abstract information...Most participants use haptics as a navigation tool which guides them entering and leaving the bars.

Sometimes they want to extract estimated data values and other times they want the actual data values. The guideline proposes that gridlines should not be used if the purpose of the visualization is to get exact values in order not to mislead them.,"Gridlines provide an aid to find the values on a haptic graph. However, the experiment results showed that they were not very effective and not every participant could use them easily. There are four fundamental problems associated with this kind of haptic gridlines. First of all, the uneven surface caused by the raised gridlines may distract users from searching the data lines. Secondly, gridlines are often overlapped by data lines and thus become very difficult to count. Thirdly, they only provide approximate values which are not so useful when exact 
values are required. Finally, it is very time consuming to count the gridlines because users need to remember the counted numbers in cases of comparing different points on",,None,None,None,,,,
